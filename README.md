An attempt to explain the layout of the directories.

3d_daostorm - The core code to perform 3D-DAOSTORM analysis.

library - A collection of Python (and C) libraries that provide
   functionality whose utility is not limited to just a support
   role for 3D-DAOSTORM (and other analysis approaches).

utilities - A collection of Python and C programs that perform
   functions such as tracking single molecules across multiple
   frames or determining and applying drift correction. These
   are used by 3D-DAOSTORM, but as with the functions in the
   library directory they are considered to be of more general 
   utility.

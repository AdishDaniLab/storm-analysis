# storm-analysis #
This is a collection of code to perform analysis of STORM movies.

# Installation #
You will need Python. Pre-compiled libraries (using MinGW) are provided for 64-bit Windows. For other operating systems you will need to compile the libraries and executables yourself as described in the README.md files in the relavant folders.

# Directory Layout #
3d_daostorm - The core code to perform 3D-DAOSTORM analysis as described in this publication (3D-DAOSTORM; http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2192-2853-1-6)

decon-storm - Matlab, C and Python code for DeconSTORM analysis as described in this publication (DeconSTORM; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.070)

library - A collection of Python (and C) libraries that provide functionality whose utility is not limited to just a support role for 3D-DAOSTORM (and other analysis approaches).

utilities - A collection of Python and C programs that perform functions such as tracking single molecules across multiple frames or determining and applying drift correction. These are used by 3D-DAOSTORM, but as with the functions in the library directory they are considered to be of more general utility.

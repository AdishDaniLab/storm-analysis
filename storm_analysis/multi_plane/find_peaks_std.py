"""
(Standard) multi-plane peak finder and fitter.

Peaks are identified using ideas from this paper:

"SNSMIL, a real-time single molecule identification and localization algorithm 
for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy", Tang et al., Scientific Reports, 2015.

"channel", "frame", "image" and "plane" are used somewhat interchangeably..

FIXME: For multi-plane data with the planes far enough part we should allow
       two peaks to have a similar x,y location if their z locations are
       different enough.

FIXME: Overly complicated? Would it work just as well to transform all the
       input images and sCMOS calibration data first, then do the fitting
       on the transformed image? This would be a lot simpler..

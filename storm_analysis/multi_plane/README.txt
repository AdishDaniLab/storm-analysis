This can used to fit biplane or multi-plane SMLM data. It includes
the ability to analyze data from a sCMOS camera.


Python Programs:

mapper - A GUI for identifying the mapping between different data
   planes.

psf_localizations - Used to select localizations for PSF determination.
   These are localizations whose positions are inside all of the data
   planes, and that are not too close to each other.

psf_zstack - Used to create the average z_stack of the PSF localizations
   that is used for PSF measurement.

L1H - The core code to perform l1H analysis as described in this publication [L1H](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.21.028583)

daostorm_3D - The core code to perform 3D-DAOSTORM analysis as described in this publication [3D-DAOSTORM](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2192-2853-1-6)

db_scan - Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) as described in this publication [Ester et al](http://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037)

decon-storm - Matlab, C and Python code for DeconSTORM analysis as described in this publication [DeconSTORM](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.070)

fista - The core code to perform FISTA image deconvolution as described in this publication [Beck and Teboulle](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080716542)

frc - The core code to perform FRC analysis as described in this publication [Nieuwenhuizen et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2448)

rcc - The core code to perform RCC drift correction as described in this publication [Wang et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.015982)

rolling_ball_bgr - The core code to perform rolling ball based background estimation.

sCMOS - The core code to perform analysis of data from a sCMOS camera as described in this publication [Huang et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2488)

sa_library - A collection of Python (and C) libraries that provide functionality whose utility is not limited to just a support role for 3D-DAOSTORM (and other analysis approaches).

sa_utilities - A collection of Python and C programs that perform functions such as tracking single molecules across multiple frames or determining and applying drift correction. These are used by 3D-DAOSTORM, but as with the functions in the library directory they are considered to be of more general utility.

simulator - A simple simulator for generating test data.

spliner - The core code to perform C-Spline analysis as described in [..]. This work builds on previous work described in this publication [Kirshner, Vonesch and Unser](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2013.6556543)

tests - Simple tests of 3D-DAOSTORM, sCMOS and other programs to verify that they work. This might also be a good place to look to get an idea of how different programs are run.

visualizer - A PyQt4 based application that draws the found localizations on frame in which they were found.

voronoi - Voronoi diagram based clustering similar to what is described in this publication [Levet et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3579)

wavelet_bgr - The core code to perform wavelet based background estimation as described in this publication [Galloway et al](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/as/abstract.cfm?URI=as-63-12-1370).

windows_dll - The other DLLs that you will need to get the 3D-DAOSTORM analysis to work on windows.

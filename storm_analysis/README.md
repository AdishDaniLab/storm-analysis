L1H - The code to perform l1H analysis as described in this publication [Babcock et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.21.028583).

c_libraries - The location of the C libraries once they have been built. This also contains DLLs that you may need to get this package to work on windows (LAPACK, FFTW).

daostorm_3D - The code to perform 3D-DAOSTORM analysis as described in this publication [Babcock et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2192-2853-1-6).

dbscan - Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) following [Ester et al](http://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037).

decon-storm - Matlab, C and Python code for DeconSTORM analysis as described in this publication [Mukamel et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2012.03.070).

diagnostics - Code for evaluating the performance of different aspects of the different fitters, drift correction, etc..

fista - The code to perform FISTA image deconvolution following [Beck and Teboulle](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080716542).

frc - The code to perform FRC analysis following [Nieuwenhuizen et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2448).

micrometry - Automatically find the affine transform between two localization files using geometric hashing.

multi_plane - Analysis of one or more planes of data from sCMOS camera(s), using one of the following PSF models (1) measured PSF, (2) pupil function or (3) 3D cubic spline. Please reference [Babcock](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41598-018-19981-z).

psf_fft - The core code to analyze SMLM movies by fitting the measured PSF (using a FFT based approach).

pupilfn - The core code to analyze SMLM movies by fitting pupil functions.

rcc - The core code to perform RCC drift correction following [Wang et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.015982).

rolling_ball_bgr - The core code to perform rolling ball based background estimation.

sCMOS - The core code to perform analysis of data from a sCMOS camera following [Huang et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2488).

sa_library - A collection of Python (and C) libraries that provide functionality whose utility is not limited to just a support role for 3D-DAOSTORM (and other analysis approaches).

sa_utilities - A collection of Python and C programs that perform functions such as tracking single molecules across multiple frames or determining and applying drift correction. These are used by 3D-DAOSTORM, but as with the functions in the library directory they are considered to be of more general utility.

simulator - A simple simulator for generating test data.

spliner - The core code to perform C-Spline analysis as described in [Babcock and Zhuang](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00622-w).

tests - Simple tests of 3D-DAOSTORM, sCMOS and other programs to verify that they work. This might also be a good place to look to get an idea of how different programs are run.

visualizer - A PyQt5 based application that draws the found localizations on frame in which they were found.

voronoi - Voronoi diagram based clustering following [Levet et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3579).

wavelet_bgr - The core code to perform wavelet based background estimation following [Galloway et al](http://www.opticsinfobase.org/as/abstract.cfm?URI=as-63-12-1370).

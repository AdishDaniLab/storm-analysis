# Measure the PSF given the raw data and localization analysis. In
# theory this will be more accurate as you are using fit locations
# instead of locations that were entered by hand.
#
# FIXME: Should use z position file instead of fit z?
#
# 2D: The expected input is a movie file that contains images
#     of single molecules & the corresponding analysis file
#     as created by Spliner, 3D-DAOSTORM, sCMOS or Insight3.
#
# 3D: The expected input is a movie file that contains images of
#     single molecules at different z positions. This movie file
#     needs to have been analyzed with Spliner, 3D-DAOSTORM, sCMOS or 
#     Insight3.
#
# Similar to measure_psf_beads, depending on your setup you may need to change:
#  1. The z range (z_range).
#  2. The pixel size (pixel_size).
#  3. The AOI size (aoi_size). This is less important as you
#     will get to specify the final size to use when you use
#     psf_to_spline.py to create the spline to use for fitting.

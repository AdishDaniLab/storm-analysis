# Measure the 3D PSF a movie given the locations of the beads
# of interest in the movie and the z-offset of each frame of
# the movie. It is assumed that the drift over the time
# course of the movie is neglible.
#
# Depending on your setup you may need to change:
#  1. The z range (z_range).
#  2. The pixel size (pixel_size).
#  3. The AOI size (aoi_size). This is less important as you
#     will get to specify the final size to use when you use
#     psf_to_spline.py to create the spline to use for fitting.

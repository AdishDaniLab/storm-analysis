This directory includes a sparse peak finder designed for analysis of
data from a sCMOS camera, along with several utility programs. The
algorithms are based on those described in this reference:

"Video-rate nanoscopy using sCMOS camera-specific single-molecule localization algorithms"
F. Huang et al. Nature Methods, 10, p653-658.

The sCMOS code has the same dependencies as the 3D-DAOSTORM code. You
will need to follow the instructions in the 3D-DAOSTORM README.txt file
in order to get everything set up.

This is still a work in progress..
